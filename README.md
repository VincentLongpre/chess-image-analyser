# Chess Image Analyser

This project aims to simplify the process of analysing chess positions found in videos or books using analysis tools like the [lichess analysis board](https://lichess.org/analysis). The application takes an image of the position as input, extracts the information and redirects the user to a preloaded analysis board. This work is improving over the 2018 [chessputzer software](https://github.com/metterklume/chessputzer).
